## A little about me
Hi everyone, I'm Kara. I'm a Silicon Valley native who is still a resident of
this wonderful, kind, and innovative place. I attended UC San Diego for my
education where I received an education in maths, computer science, and
chemistry. Ideas and passion easily fascinate me so you'll
often find me going on binges of books, documentations, collected data, and
asking a barrage of questions to the nearest person whose eyes are lit with passion.

## A little about this site
I thought it'd be a good idea to have a place to host/index (software) "toys" I
build so that they may have a place to live rather than be hopelessly forgotten.

There are also some things I strongly feel about so it just seems more satisfactory
to shout out into the void than to hold these ideas and opinions to myself.
In addition I often have to convince myself about certain things or to demonstrate
I learned (something about) a particular topic. Verbalizing is one of the best ways
I know how. This site's blog is a manifestation of these two and I hope anyone
out there reading will find some interest or enjoyment from what I write.

## A little about this site (technical)
This site is statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and graciously
hosted for free through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme is
something I made and is named after a beautiful cat named
[Mila](http://github.com/ryaka/mila). For all the major styling, I'm using
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). The fonts used are
[Ramabhadra](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ramabhadra) for the
hero images and titles while all the content font is
[Archivo Black](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo+Black).
