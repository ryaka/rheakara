                <h4> A post on how this blog came to be. </h4>
            </div>
        </div>

<p>For some background, I was previously using Squarespace to host an equivalent
personal site. It started with the very good intentions of making (semi-)regular
blog posts on whatever caught my interests and to also have a place serving as
a portfolio / contact. Squarespace at the time fit the needs of my unjustified urgency
to have something up and running, and just like that, I was a member.</p>

<p>Ignoring the fact that I barely, if at all, used the site, there were two major
points that bothered me greatly. In particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paying $16/month for a very low traffic website</li>
<li>Not having reliable backup</li>
</ul>

<p>After some recent circumstantial changes, I finally found myself with much more
time and decided to finally move off of Squarespace. I eventually settled on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> after some research as a nice solution to these problems.</p>

<h2 id="paying-0-month-for-a-insert-here-traffic-website">Paying $0/month for a (insert here) traffic website</h2>

<p>Initially I considered moving over to <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">AWS S3</a>
as it is a familiar part of my
recent past, present, and (likely) near future. However what steered me away from
this was the discovery of <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which offers
free static website hosting. Thankfully I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM">RTFM&rsquo;d</a>
as spending time on <a href="https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/">Hugo&rsquo;s docs</a>
quickly pointed me in the direction of this hosting option.</p>

<p>In contrast to AWS S3, Github Pages offers free hosting for static websites. Given
that I don&rsquo;t expect things to be very high traffic, it at most it saves me literally
&ldquo;pennies&rdquo; vs AWS S3 as I estimate the latter would have cost me something like a nickel
a month. But then again I&rsquo;m already I&rsquo;m on a roll at cutting expenditures so why not just eek out the rest of the marginal returns right?</p>

<p>But seriously, what really reeled me in was that I&rsquo;d already planned to use Git so it was
just too convenient of a choice not to go with. As for the reason why I wanted to use
Git, it was because it would serve as both a VCS and my potential backup.</p>

<h2 id="having-a-reliable-backup">Having a reliable backup</h2>

<p>Using Git to keep track of my changes allows me to easily have a copy of all
past states of my blog. If for some reason I impetuously decided to delete a bunch
of posts or change my layouts dramatically only to regret it the next day, no
problem. It&rsquo;s as simple as reverting those changes to get back everything I want. So
using Git (or any VCS), something I would be unable to do so using
Squarespace, essentially allows me to have a backup of all publications of my
website for any point in time.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t ignored AWS S3 completely as I store a compressed backup there. According to
their FAQ:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/#data-protection">if you store 10,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000,000 years</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>which makes it really nice to have around either way even if I am not using it as
a hosting service, and instead just as a compressed dump store instead.</p>

<p>Since the move I no longer have that nagging voice in my head about &ldquo;that one&rdquo;
unnecessary expenditure. I also now have a very durable backup(s) of my site, so
I rest much more at ease at knowing I likely won&rsquo;t lose anything or be held hostage
for this data.</p>

<p>For those interested, everything related to this blog can be found in these
two repositories:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryaka/rheakara">Website content</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ryaka/mila">Hugo theme used</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I warn you there isn&rsquo;t really any documentation(at the time of this writing) but
I do intent to add them. Feel free to use the theme if you&rsquo;d like however I don&rsquo;t
have any plans to offer support or promises against breaking changes as I&rsquo;m making
changes to fit my needs as they arise.</p>
