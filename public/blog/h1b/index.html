<h1 id="checking-h-1b-claims">Checking H-1B Claims</h1>

<p>The H-1B visa program has recently become a hot button topic. President Trump&rsquo;s
administration have made allegations that the program has been abused to replace
American workers with cheap labor. One claim the administration specifically
made is &ldquo;that about 80 percent of H1B workers are paid less than the median
wage in their fields&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The result of that is that workers are often brought in well below market rates
to replace American workers <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/17/background-briefing-buy-american-hire-american-executive-order">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nasscom, an Indian IT lobby, responded to accusations by stating that the workers
exported are highly skilled and that it is to meet a shortage in skills in the
United States.</p>

<p>Given that the issue has become a political topic with contradicting assertions on
both sides, I wanted to take a look at the available data and try to make some
conclusions for myself.</p>

<h2 id="methods">Methods</h2>

<p>The data used for this comes from the US Department of Labor&rsquo;s disclosure on
the LCA program <a href="https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm">here</a>.</p>

<p>The LCA is a document employers are required to fill out and get approved before
they can file for an H-1B visa. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Condition_Application">purpose</a>
is to protect workers from being taken advantage of and to protect American wages.</p>

<p>Because the US DOL does not publish the H-1B data directly, the LCA&rsquo;s are used as
a proxy to determine applications for the H-1B visas. The method rests on the
assumption that employers filing an LCA will likely proceed to file for an H-1B visa.</p>

<p>In addition, only LCA applications submitted in February and March are used. This
is because H-1B applications have historically opened in early April. These two
months are close enough to it that I believe there is a high correlation of the
LCA applications submitted in this time period being submitted to H-1B. The anomalous
submissions for these two months somewhat support this.</p>

<p>Some back of the envelope calculations also seem to give decent numbers.</p>

<p><em>TODO</em></p>

<p>Granted, this is still not conclusive. but at the very least the general trends
and compositions should be the same.</p>

<p>As a quick aside, I initially planned to use data graciously published by a user
off Kaggle <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/nsharan/h-1b-visa">here</a>. Unfortunately some of the
information I wanted were removed in the sanitizing process.</p>

<p>As a result I proceeded to cleanse the data myself. The process for that is
published in this <a href="google.com">post</a>.</p>

<p>Between 2010 and 2017, the number of applications grew from an estimated 60,000
applications to 300,000. The bulk of this growth started in 2012 and continued
up to 2016.</p>

<h3 id="there-was-little-to-no-growth-from-2016-2017">There was little to no growth from 2016-2017</h3>

<p>The top 8 applied for positions as defined by the US government&rsquo;s SOC system,
computer and software positions make up at least 175,000 applications for 2017.

<p>The net number of H1B applications from this industry (using SOC classification)
group dropped about 10,000 from the previous year. As a whole the number of applications
dropped from around 71% of all applications to 67%.</p>

<p>The White House recently made <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/04/17/background-briefing-buy-american-hire-american-executive-order">accusations</a> that some companies are abusing the H-1B system by flooding the
system with applications to get a disproportionate amount of visas. In addition to
this claim, it is alleged that the workers are &ldquo;actually less skilled and lower
paid than the workers that theyâ€™re replacing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Some companies specifically named were &ldquo;Tata, Infosys, Cognizant&rdquo;. Despite not
naming India specifically, there seemed to have been enough innuendo such that
Nasscom, an Indian IT lobby, <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/tcs-infosys-got-only-8-8-of-total-h-1b-visas-nasscom-s-rebuttal-to-us-117042401271_1.html">responded to accusations</a> by stating that the workers exported are highly

<p>Looking at the top 20 applicants, we can see that the data supports Nasscom&rsquo;s claim.
Namely these companies would be Infosys, Tata, IBM India, Wipro, Larsen &amp; Toubro, and Cognizant.</p>

<p>Something to note is that the range for these 6 companies actually
<strong>fall within the top 15</strong>, which increases the relative weight. In addition, if
we also include companies that are merely American based subsidiaries but India
headquartered, this would include HCL America and Tech Mahindra.</p>

<p>This means that <strong>at least 8 of the top 15 H-1B applicants for 2015 are either India based
or have a parent company which is India based</strong>.</p>

<p>This trend also holds over the entire 2010 - 2017 period.</p>

<p>The top 10 indian applicants reached a peak back in 2015 and as a net have
decreased tremendously in the past 2 years. Infosys is perhaps the most dramatic,
dropping from a high of ~18,000 applications in 2015 to ~9,000 in 2017.</p>

<h2 id="trends-in-wages">Trends in wages</h2>

<p>One of the accusations by the White House has been that the workers
brought in by the supposed H-1B abusers are a form of cheap labor.</p>

<p>To check on these claims, the median wages for the top 5 positions brought over
by each of the top 6 Indian IT firms was calculated. In order to take geography
into account, the wages were were calculated for each city.</p>

<p>The heatmaps below show the workers&rsquo; wages for the top 5 positions in the top 5
worksite cities for each company. To reduce variance, values are shown only if
there are at least 10 such workers at each worksite.</p>

<p>The percentage of the workers&rsquo; wage vs the market wage in the same geo is also
shown. The values for this are calculate using the workers&rsquo; wage and prevailing
wage filed by employers.</p>

<p>Exemplary heatmaps are chosen below to save space. A full gallery for all the
companies can be found <a href="google.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike some of the major tech names such as Google, Microsoft, etc. the majority

central metropolitan areas.</p>

<p>In regards to the market wage provided by H-1B employers, the workers brought
in by the top Indian IT firms are paid mostly above the market.</p>

<h2 id="but-not-so-fast-questions-on-the-wages">But Not So Fast. Questions On The Wages.</h2>

<p>Using the numbers provided by H-1B employers, the workers brought in to the
US seem to <strong>not</strong> be cheap labor being paid under market wages.</p>

<p>However, during this process, I ran across something strange. When we compare
the wage maps between the Indian IT firms and major household-name American firms
such as Google, Microsoft, etc. we see an extremely contrasted picture.</p>

<p>(As above, a full gallery can be found <a href="google.com">here</a>)</p>

<h2 id="why-do-top-indian-it-firms-pay-so-much-below-top-american-firms">Why Do Top Indian IT Firms Pay So Much Below Top American Firms?</h2>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://www.rheakara.com/img/num_wage_google.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>If we look at the wages for the <strong>American firms</strong>, the workers are consistently
<strong>paid significantly higher</strong>.</p>

<p>I was certainly expecting that the top American firms would pay higher for their
workers and I&rsquo;m sure many readers were expecting the same. After all, many workers
dream of working at many of these companies. In addition many of them are located
in areas with a high cost of living. But still I did not expect just how extreme the
difference would be.</p>

<p>Using this result, a question I have is if the amount of workers brought in is
simply to fit a massive demand / shortage of supply in the United States, how can
there be such a disparity in wages? The United States&rsquo; timezones (ignoring Hawaii / Alaska)
vary only 3 hours so I would have assumed that some form of labor arbitrage, perhaps
with telecommuting, would have removed this amount of variance.</p>

<p>A possible explanation I looked into was geography. Looking at the percentage
difference to the market wage, we can see that it is not too different from many
Indian IT firms.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://www.rheakara.com/img/perc_wage_google.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>However this only led to another question&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="why-do-top-indian-it-firms-apply-workers-under-such-different-positions">Why Do Top Indian IT Firms Apply Workers Under Such Different Positions?</h2>

<p>The values above were calculated by looking at just 5 possible tech positions and
calculating the relative percentage composition for each company.</p>

<p>For example, for some company A:</p>

<pre><code>num_workers = [12, 14, 29, 60, 16]
percentage_values = num_workers / sum(num_workers)
</code></pre>

        <img src="https://www.rheakara.com/img/perc_position_big.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>We can see that Indian IT firms exceedingly do not file their workers under
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/2010/soc151132.htm">software developer</a>, but instead
the workers are filed under <a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/2010/soc151199.htm">one</a> of
<a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/2010/soc151131.htm">several</a> <a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/2010/soc151121.htm">others</a>.
This is <strong>exceedingly contrary</strong> to many of the top American firms. Why is this?</p>

<h2 id="what-do-these-title-differences-mean">What Do These Title Differences Mean?</h2>

<p>The titles used are from the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/">SOC</a> codes filed with
every application.</p>

<p>As a person in tech, the titles of computer programmer and software developer
are mostly interchangeable with one another to me. To try and understand the difference,
I looked into the definitions but even these seemed interchangeable with one
another. I also looked at the titles used by the companies internally and it
still was ambiguous, with the titles being things like &ldquo;Technology Lead&rdquo;, &ldquo;Computer
Programmer&rdquo;, &ldquo;Programmer Analyst&rdquo; and &ldquo;Developer&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The question I have then is how are these titles determined for workers and
what about it makes them disqualified to be applied as software developers in
accordance to SOC?</p>

<h2 id="most-top-indian-it-firm-workers-are-paid-relatively-less-than-software-devs">Most Top Indian IT Firm Workers Are Paid Relatively Less Than Software Devs</h2>

<p>For the sake of curiosity, I plotted what wages for the Indian IT companies&rsquo;
workers compared to H-1B software developers in the same geo looked like.</p>


<figure >
    
        <img src="https://www.rheakara.com/img/perc_wage_wipro_compare.png" />
    
    
</figure>


<p>From this it seems that many Indian IT workers outside of IBM India and Tech
Mahindra are paid significantly less than those filed <a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc/2010/soc151132.htm">software devs</a>,
adding credence to there being a cause for the difference.</p>

<h1 id="take-away">Take Away</h1>

<p>In the past 8 years, the number of H-1B visa applications has grown nearly five-fold.
Such growth has not gone unnoticed and has become a political top, with calls for
reform abound.</p>

<p>In my quest to make sense of the contradicting claims on the opposing sides, I&rsquo;ve learned
just how tech industry dominant the visas applied for is. I&rsquo;ve also learned that
many Indian IT firms also started to significantly pull back starting in 2015
and continue to present day.</p>

<p>However I also found a peculiar difference between the types of positions that
major Indian IT firms were applying for and major American IT firms were
applying for. The types of positions filed for by the former in general are paid
significantly less than the types of positions filed for by the latter, despite
the difference in the definition of the positions being unclear (at least to me).</p>

<p>What exactly is the cause of this difference?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it because the workers are in fact less skilled as claimed by the White House so they are filed differently?</li>
<li>Is it because it allows these companies to pay the workers less for the same job because the prevailing wages for these titles are less than that of software devs?</li>
<li>Or is it because of something else much more sinister or innocuous?</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately this is something I&rsquo;m so far unable to conclude, but the
data so far appears dubious and potentially supports the White House&rsquo;s claims.</p>

<p>There are still TODOs so consider this a less rough draft</p>
